{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "53947b72c10600f206f8a4fc" }, "abstract" : "Developers who work with quantities (sensor reading from edge devices, scientific, engineering, medical, or manufacturing) need to handle measurements of these quantities in their programs. Inadequate models of physical measurements can lead to programmatic errors. In particular when modelling a measurement as a simple number with no regard to the units it represents creates fragile code. Another developer or part of the system can misinterpret the number as a different unit. For example, it may be unclear whether a person's mass is expressed in pounds, kilograms, or stones. A human reading „10°C“, „10 C“ or simply „10 Degrees“ may interpret each of those correctly. For M2M communication, unless a program contains a „Babel Fish“, such ambiguity would not be acceptable.\nDon’t Panic: After programming languages like Ada, C++, Eiffel or F# added type-safe Unit support already, JSR 363, Units of Measurement API adds similar support to the Java Platform, making it competitive for M2M in the Internet of Things with strong emphasis on sensors. \nThis session provides an overview of popular use cases for the Units of Measurement JSR and implementations on both Java ME 8 Embedded (CLDC 8) and Java SE.

As such, it is important for Java developers to understand the actions you can take in selecting and tuning collector mechanisms, as well as in your application architecture choices.

Following a quick overview of common garbage collection techniques including generational, parallel, stop-the-world, incremental, concurrent and mostly-concurrent algorithms, he defines terms and metrics common to all collectors.
